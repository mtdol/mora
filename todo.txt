- should I allow variable shadowing?
```
dec a;
a <- 3;
{dec a <- 2;}
-- prints 3
@a;
```

- variable declaration scope
```
{dec a <- 3; @a; {-okay-}}
-- illegal
@a;
```
perhaps use static var renaming for this


- allow sub-procedures
```
fn f x {
    fn g y {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```
perhaps lift the sub-procs to the global space (to allow recursion)
    and then do static variable renaming


- allow file manipulation, probably with file handles
