- figure out how to use haskell sufficiently
    - figure out how to use the haskell lexer and parser

- think about the type system
    - study Hindley-Milner algorithm and how it can relate
        to an imperative language
    - think about the current ideas for the type system and
        try to come up with counter examples.

- find a suitable IR for the language
    - C-- ?
    - llvm ?
    - C ?
    - x86 ?

- how will the macro system work?
    - pre-processor directives similar to C
    - macros should look like functions and operators and
        should be handled post-parse
    - mixed sterile and non-sterile macros
